# Backend Issues — 3 Devs × 3 Issues (9 total)

**Team:** Backend only (3 developers)  
**Base branch:** `main`  
**Rule:** Every issue must ship **working API endpoints + passing tests**. "Done" = curl/Postman proves it, and `php artisan test` proves it.

> **Before you start:** read [../00-PROJECT-BRIEF.md](../00-PROJECT-BRIEF.md) first — it explains what the whole project is for. Then read [../teams/BACKEND-TEAM-GUIDE.md](../teams/BACKEND-TEAM-GUIDE.md), then come back here for your specific issue.

Each issue file below is **copy-paste ready** for a GitHub Issue (title + body), and ends with a **🤖 AI Development Prompt** you can paste directly into Cursor/agent chat to build it.

## Golden rules for every issue

1. **Read first:** [teams/SHARED-DATA-CONTRACT.md](../teams/SHARED-DATA-CONTRACT.md) — field names/enums are law.
2. **One branch per issue**, always branched from latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b backend/<branch-name>
   ```
3. **Migrations:** use `php artisan make:migration ...` (auto-timestamped) — avoids merge conflicts between devs.
4. **Every endpoint must return the exact JSON shape** in SHARED-DATA-CONTRACT / [05-api-contract.md](../05-api-contract.md).
5. **Every issue ships tests** in `tests/Feature/` (PHPUnit, already used in this repo) — no issue is "done" without green tests.
6. **Error format** is always:
   ```json
   { "message": "string", "code": "STRING_CODE", "errors": { "field": ["msg"] } }
   ```
7. Open a PR into `main`, link the issue number, request review from one other dev.

## Suggested merge order (reduce conflicts)

```text
1. #1 Auth API           (Dev A) → merge first, everyone needs users/tokens
2. #2 Challenges API      (Dev A) → merge second, check-ins depend on it
3. #4 Check-ins API       (Dev B) → after #2
4. #5 Dashboard/Recovery  (Dev B) → after #4
5. #3 Categories/Templates(Dev A) → parallel, low conflict risk
6. #6 Gamification/Admin  (Dev B) → after #3 + #4
7. #7 AI Motivation       (Dev C) → parallel, needs #2 (challenge fields)
8. #8 AI RAG Chat         (Dev C) → parallel, independent tables
9. #9 Testing & QA        (Dev C) → continuous, finalized last (covers 1–8)
```

Rebase on `main` daily. If two people touch `routes/api.php`, resolve by keeping both route groups — never delete another dev's routes.
